Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

### Do all cloud storage systems support all rclone commands ###

Yes they do.  All the rclone commands (eg `sync`, `copy` etc) will
work on all the remote storage systems.


### Can rclone sync directly from drive to s3 ###

Rclone can sync between two remote cloud storage systems just fine.

Note that it effectively downloads the file and uploads it again, so
the node running rclone would need to have lots of bandwidth.

The syncs would be incremental (on a file by file basis).

Eg

   rclone sync drive:Folder s3:bucket
