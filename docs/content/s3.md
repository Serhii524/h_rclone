Paths are specified as `remote:bucket` or `remote:`

S3 paths can't refer to subdirectories within a bucket (yet).

So to copy a local directory to a s3 container called backup

    rclone sync /home/source s3:backup

Here is an example of making an s3 configuration.  First run

    rclone config

This will guide you through an interactive setup process.

```

Current remotes:

Name                 Type

remote               s3

e) Edit existing remote
n) New remote

q) Quit config
e/n/d/q> q
```

This remote is called `remote` and can now be used like this

See all buckets

    rclone lsd remote:

Make a new bucket

    rclone mkdir remote:bucket

List the contents of a bucket

    rclone ls remote:bucket

Sync `/home/local/directory` to the remote bucket, deleting any excess
files in the bucket.

    rclone sync /home/local/directory remote:bucket
