Change lsd command so it doesn't show -1
  * Make sure all Fses show -1 for objects Zero for dates etc
  * Make test?

Put the TestRemote names into the Fs description
Make test_all.sh use the TestRemote name automatically

Run errcheck and go vet in the make file
.. Also race detector?

Get rid of Storable?

Write developer manual

Todo
  * FIXME: More -dry-run checks for object transfer
  * Might be quicker to check md5sums first? for swift <-> swift certainly, and maybe for small files
  * swift: Ignoring the pseudo directories
    * if object.PseudoDirectory {
      * fmt.Printf("%9s %19s %s\n", "Directory", "-", fs.Remote())
  * Make Account wrapper
    * make Account do progress meter
  * -timeout: Make all timeouts be settable with command line parameters
  * Add max object size to fs metadata - 5GB for swift, infinite for local, ? for s3
    * tie into -max-size flag
  * FIXME Make NewFs to return err.IsAnObject so can put the LimitedFs
    creation in common code? Or try for as much as possible?
  * FIXME Account all the transactons (ls etc) using a different
    Roundtripper wrapper which wraps the transactions?

More rsync features
  * include
  * exclude
  * max size
  * -c, --checksum              skip based on checksum, not mod-time & size

Ideas for flags
  * --retries N flag which would make rclone retry a sync until successful or it tried N times.

Ideas
  * could do encryption - put IV into metadata?
  * optimise remote copy container to another container using remote
    copy if local is same as remote - use an optional Copier interface
  * support
      * sftp
      * scp
      * rsync over ssh
  * control times sync (which is slow with some remotes) with -a --archive flag?
  * Copy a glob pattern - could do with LimitedFs

Bugs
  * Non verbose - not sure number transferred got counted up? CHECK
  * When doing copy it recurses the whole of the destination FS which isn't necessary
