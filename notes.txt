make 100% compatible with swift.py?

Make Env vars compatible with st?

Get and put the metadata in the libray (x-object-meta-mtime) when getting and putting a file?

This also puts meta-mtime
https://github.com/gholt/swiftly

As an integer, but it does parse it as a float
subargs.append('x-object-meta-mtime:%d' % getmtime(options.input_))

Need an iterate all objects routine... Could use a channel
- could just be a flag to Objects()

FIXME ordering not hash order

FIXME progress meter would be nice! Do this by wrapping the Reader with a progress bar

Do bandwidth limit by wrapping the Reader too

If length is same but remote has no mtime, then could fall back to checking the checksum and if that was OK then just update the object meta time.

Could have an integrity check mode where we check the MD5sums of the local vs the remote
