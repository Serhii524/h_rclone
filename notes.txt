Todo
  * FIXME: More -dry-run checks for object transfer
  * Check logging in various parts
  * Make logging controllable with flags (mostly done)
  * progress meter would be nice! Do this by wrapping the Reader with a progress bar
  * Do bandwidth limit by wrapping the Reader too
      * Maybe using https://jra-go.googlecode.com/hg/linkio/ which will work for multiple
        uploads or downloads. 
      * code.google.com/p/mxk/go1/flowcontrol - only does one flow at once
      * Or maybe put into swift library.
  * -timeout: Make all timeouts be settable with command line parameters
  * Check the locking in swift module!
  * Windows paths? Do we need to translate / and \?
  * Make a fs.Errorf and count errors and log them at a different level
  * add -modify-window flag - fs should keep knowledge of resolution

Ideas
  * optimise remote copy container to another container using remote
    copy if local is same as remote
  * Allow subpaths container:/sub/path
  * stats
  * look at auth from env in s3 module - add to swift?

Make a wrapper in connection which
  * measures bandwidth and reports it
  * limits bandwidth using Reader and Writer
  * for a pool of all individual connectinos
  * does timeouts by setting a limit, seeing whether io has happened
    and resetting it if it has

Need to make directory objects otherwise can't upload an empty directory
  * Or could upload empty directories only?
  * Can't purge a local filesystem because it leaves the directories behind

Can maybe set last modified?

Otherwise can set metadata
